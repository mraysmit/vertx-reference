# API Gateway Documentation

After a thorough search of the project, I found that the documentation explaining the API Gateway is distributed across several locations rather than being in a single dedicated document:

## Primary Documentation Sources

1. **Project README.md**
   - Contains a high-level overview of the API Gateway as the "Entry point for the application, routes requests to microservices"
   - Includes information about running the API Gateway and the endpoints it exposes
   - Located at the root of the project: `README.md`

2. **Source Code Javadoc Comments**
   - `ApiGatewayMain.java` has a brief description: "Main entry point for the API Gateway. Configures and starts the Vert.x instance and deploys the API Gateway verticle."
   - `ApiGatewayVerticle.java` has a comment: "API Gateway Verticle. Handles HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate microservices."
   - These files are located in: `api-gateway/src/main/java/dev/mars/vertx/gateway/`

3. **Configuration File**
   - The `config.yaml` file in `api-gateway/src/main/resources/` contains configuration settings for the API Gateway but doesn't include explanatory documentation

## No Dedicated Documentation File

There doesn't appear to be a dedicated documentation file specifically explaining the API Gateway's architecture, design decisions, or internal workings in detail. The most comprehensive understanding of the API Gateway comes from:

1. Reading the README.md for a high-level overview
2. Examining the source code (particularly ApiGatewayVerticle.java) to understand the implementation details
3. Reviewing the configuration in config.yaml to understand the configurable aspects

## Recommendation

If you need more detailed documentation about the API Gateway, you might want to consider:

1. Creating a dedicated markdown file in the `.docs` directory (which already contains `design.md`)
2. Enhancing the Javadoc comments in the source code
3. Adding more explanatory comments in the configuration file

This would make it easier for new developers to understand the API Gateway's purpose, design, and implementation without having to piece together information from multiple sources.
