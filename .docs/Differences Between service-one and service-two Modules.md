# Differences Between service-one and service-two Modules

After investigating the codebase, I've found that service-two contains duplicate implementations of classes that already exist in the common modules, while service-one properly uses the shared code from these common modules.

## Duplicate Classes in service-two

service-two contains the following duplicate classes that should be imported from common modules:

1. **From common-metrics module:**
   - `dev.mars.vertx.common.metrics.MetricsManager` - A simplified 30-line version of the full 136-line implementation in common-metrics

2. **From common-core module:**
   - `dev.mars.vertx.common.util.ThreadPoolConfig` - A simplified 35-line version of the full 89-line implementation in common-core
   - `dev.mars.vertx.common.util.ShutdownManager`
   - `dev.mars.vertx.common.util.ExceptionHandler`

## Dependency Configuration

Interestingly, both service-one and service-two have identical pom.xml files with the same dependencies on all common modules:
- common-core
- common-config
- common-eventbus
- common-metrics
- common-resilience

This means service-two should be using the common modules just like service-one does, but it has duplicate implementations instead.

## Usage Differences

- **service-one** properly imports and uses classes from the common modules
- **service-two** imports some classes from common modules (like ServiceDiscoveryManager from common-eventbus) but also uses its own duplicate implementations

## Likely Explanation

This inconsistency suggests one of the following scenarios:

1. **Development Timeline**: service-two might have been developed earlier, before the common modules were fully established. The utility classes were later extracted to common modules for reuse, but service-two wasn't fully refactored to use them.

2. **Independent Development**: The modules might have been developed by different teams or developers with different approaches.

3. **Transitional State**: The codebase might be in the middle of a refactoring process to standardize the use of common modules.

## Recommendation

To maintain consistency and follow best practices:

1. Remove the duplicate classes from service-two
2. Update service-two to use the proper implementations from common modules
3. Ensure both services follow the same architectural patterns

This will reduce code duplication, improve maintainability, and ensure consistent behavior across services.
