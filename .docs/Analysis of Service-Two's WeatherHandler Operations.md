# Analysis of Service-Two's WeatherHandler Operations

After examining the codebase, I've confirmed that service-two's WeatherHandler implements several domain-specific operations that are **not fully exposed in the public API**. Here's my analysis:

## Implemented Operations in WeatherHandler

The `WeatherHandler` class in service-two implements these specialized operations:

1. `getWeatherForCity(String city)` - Gets weather data for a specific city
2. `getRandomWeather()` - Gets weather data for a random city
3. `getForecast(JsonObject request)` - Gets a forecast for a city
4. `listCities()` - Lists all available cities
5. `getStats()` - Gets statistics about the service

## How These Operations Are Handled Internally

The `handleRequest` method in `WeatherHandler` can process these operations based on the request parameters:
- If the request has a "city" parameter, it calls `getWeatherForCity`
- If the request has an "action" parameter with values "forecast", "cities", or "stats", it calls the corresponding method
- If neither of the above, it defaults to `getRandomWeather`

## Public API Exposure Issue

**The problem is that most of these operations are not exposed as public HTTP endpoints in the API Gateway.** Here's what I found:

1. In the API Gateway's OpenAPI specification (`openapi.yaml`), only two endpoints are defined for service-two:
   - `GET /api/service-two/{id}` - This maps to `getWeatherForCity`
   - `POST /api/service-two` - This is for creating items

2. In the `RouterFactory` class, only these same two routes are configured:
   ```java
   router.get("/api/service-two/:id").handler(handlers.get("getServiceTwoItem")::handle);
   router.post("/api/service-two").handler(handlers.get("createServiceTwoItem")::handle);
   ```

3. The specialized operations (`getForecast`, `listCities`, `getStats`, `getRandomWeather`) are **not exposed** as public HTTP endpoints.

## How Requests Are Processed

When a request comes to the API Gateway:
1. It's routed based on the path and method
2. The `ServiceTwoHandler` creates a request object from the routing context
3. The request is sent to service-two via the event bus
4. The `WeatherHandler` in service-two processes the request based on its parameters
5. The response is sent back to the API Gateway

## Conclusion

While service-two's `WeatherHandler` has the capability to handle specialized operations, these operations are not accessible through the public API because:

1. There are no defined routes in the API Gateway's OpenAPI specification
2. There are no configured routes in the `RouterFactory`

To expose these operations, you would need to:

1. Add new endpoint definitions to the OpenAPI specification
2. Add new routes in the `RouterFactory` class
3. Ensure the routes send the appropriate parameters to trigger the specialized operations

For example, to expose the forecast operation, you might add:
```java
router.get("/api/service-two/forecast/:city").handler(handlers.get("getServiceTwoForecast")::handle);
```

And ensure the handler sets the "action" parameter to "forecast" in the request object.
